# InfraScan

**Open Source IaC Cost & Security Scanner**

InfraScan analyzes Infrastructure as Code to identify cost antipatterns and security issues before deployment.

## 📦 Installation

Requires Python 3.8+

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd InfraScan

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install security scanners (optional but recommended)
chmod +x install_scanners.sh
./install_scanners.sh
```

**Configuration**: Copy and edit `.env` file to choose container scanner:
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit to select container scanner: docker-scout (default) or grype
CONTAINER_SCANNER=docker-scout
```

**Note**: The app works without container scanning - it will be skipped if not installed. Docker must be installed for Docker Scout to work.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Web Application

```bash
python3 app.py
```
Open browser at `http://localhost:5000`

**Scanner Options:**
- **Fast**: Quick cost optimization scan (19 regex rules)
- **Containers**: Container vulnerability scanning (Docker Scout or Grype)
- **Checkov**: IaC Security checks only
- **Comprehensive**: All scanners combined (Cost + Security + Containers)

**Report Features:**
- **Grade Cards**: Visual A-F grades for Overall, Cost, and Security
- **Risk Assessment**: Low to Critical risk levels
- **Severity Breakdown**: High/Medium/Low issue counts
- **Smart Recommendations**: Actionable next steps based on your findings

## 📊 Grading System

InfraScan provides four separate grades:

1. **Cost Optimization Grade**: Based on regex scanner findings (old instances, expensive resources, etc.)
2. **IaC Security Grade**: Based on Checkov findings (vulnerabilities, misconfigurations)
3. **Container Security Grade**: Based on container scanner findings (Docker Scout or Grype)
4. **Overall Grade**: Weighted average (~33% Cost + ~33% IaC Security + ~33% Container Security)

**Grade Scale:**
- **A (95-100%)**: Excellent - Low risk
- **B (85-94%)**: Good - Medium risk
- **C (70-84%)**: Fair - Medium-High risk
- **D (55-69%)**: Poor - High risk
- **F (<55%)**: Critical - Immediate action needed

**Severity Weights:**
- Critical: 4 points
- High: 3 points
- Medium: 2 points
- Low: 1 point
- Info: 0.5 points

**Grading Formula:**

*Cost Grade:*
- Weighted Score = Σ(severity_weight × count) for all findings
- Max Score = (resource_count + unique_rules) × 4
- Percentage = 100 - (Weighted Score / Max Score × 100)

*Security/Compliance Grade:*
- Only the most severe finding per resource is scored (prevents overweighting)
- Max Score = resource_count × 4
- Percentage calculation same as cost

*Severity Caps:*
- Critical findings cap grade at **C** (prevents misleading high grades)
- High findings cap grade at **B**

The system is designed to be extensible for future enhancements like historical tracking and custom scoring rules.

## 📋 Detection Rules

**19 Cost Optimization Rules** including:
- COST-001: Old generation instances (t2, m3, c4, r3)
- COST-002: Over-provisioned large instances
- COST-004: Expensive Provisioned IOPS (io1/io2)
- COST-005: Expensive NAT Gateways
- COST-009: Old generation storage (gp2 vs gp3)
- COST-010: Missing S3 lifecycle policies
- COST-011: Missing AWS budgets
- COST-012: Missing Spot instance usage
- Plus Checkov's 100+ security/compliance checks

InfraScan catches the "low-hanging fruit" in your code. 
However, the biggest cloud savings often come from architectural changes, reserved instance planning, and traffic analysis.
